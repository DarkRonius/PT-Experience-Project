# PT-Experience-Project
Scripts, mods and tools to (eventually) port the functionality of PT over to MGSV:TPP

PT could well be one of the biggest casualties of a DRM-infested world... It's an experience that will grow increasingly difficult to pass on to the next generation, as peoples PS4s fail or become obsolete.

This project aims to replicate the functionality of PT into Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain (which shares the same engine); and will actually be split into two phases:

First, to replicate the camera and controls of PT in MGSV:TPP, and ultimately to provide an alternate, immersive, gameplay experience using just the controls found in PT.

Secondly (and legally more ambiguous), to provide an easy way to port the assets from your own copy of PT into TPP, to complete the game experience (as well as providing alternate, legal, assets for those who don't own PT).

This is primarily another tool in my attempt to learn scripting, modelling and coding of MGSV. If it ever reaches the second phase, that's when things wilklk truly get serious...
